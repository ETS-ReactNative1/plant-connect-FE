#### You have the option to post your own plant, seed, or clipping that you can offer to the community by clicking `post your plants`, filling out all required fields, taking a picture of your item, then submitting that item to create your own listing.

## Set Up
- Fork this repo  
- Clone the repo to your local machine
- Run `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Run `npm start` 
- You have the option to scan a `QR code` to open the application on your mobile device 
### or
- Enter `i` to open the iOS simulator 

## Wins
- Sucessfully worked with the backend to build an application completely from scratch
- Understanding the backend engineers capabilities and best way to utilize and communicate with them
- Self taught React Native in two weeks  

## Challenges
- Viewing our application with expo and the simulator instead of the web browser
- Not having access to the web browsers dev tools that we have more familiarity with
- Learning how best to communicate and work with the backend
- Integrating the mobile camera functionality
- Testing ended up being the one of the hardest things to implement        

## Future Additions
- We would like to integrate a meetup's api in order for users to schedule group plant swapping
