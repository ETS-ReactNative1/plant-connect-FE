## Wins
- Sucessfully worked with the backend to build an application completely from scratch
- Understanding the backend engineers capabilities and best way to utilize and communicate with them
- Self taught React Native in two weeks  

## Challenges
- Viewing our application with expo and the simulator instead of the web browser
- Not having access to the web browsers dev tools that we have more familiarity with
- Learning how best to communicate and work with the backend
- Integrating the mobile camera functionality
- Testing ended up being the one of the hardest things to implement        

## Future Additions
- We would like to integrate a meetup's api in order for users to schedule group plant swapping
